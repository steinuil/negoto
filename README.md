# Negoto
Negoto is a simple and functional imageboard. It is mostly written in Ur/Web,
which makes it extremely efficient and lightweight (at least compared to the
more popular PHP-based imageboard), and [ostensibly bug-free](https://github.com/urweb/urweb#the-urweb-programming-language).

## Status
Negoto is in development and not ready to be deployed yet.


## Compiling
The very least Negoto requires to build is:

* GNU Make

The normal installation also requires:

* [sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* SQLite3

To compile, simply invoke:
